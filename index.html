                <h1>Cat Bob</h1>
                <p>Bob is a stunning cat, especially considering that when she came into our lives she only weighed five
                    pounds and had lost much of her fur. She is rather meticulous about her appearance as well and
                    continually grooms herself, keeping her fur luxe and her toe-tufts reasonably white. She also looks
                    smashing in a floppy bowtie. Since she has become an outdoor cat she has gotten some sun highlights
                    in her black fur, but this does not detract from her beauty.</p>

                <h1>Dog Rocky</h1>
                <p>Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress
                    and increasing happiness. Playing with your pup increases your brain’s levels of dopamine and
                    serotonin, both of which are neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and tranquility. So the next
                    time you’re feeling down, grab the newest toy from your BarkBox and spend some time with your pup!
                    That wagging tail will be sure to put a smile on your face.</p>

                <p>Hamsters are great pets except when they get out of their cage. I have a four year old cat and she
                    leaves the hamsters alone. She likes to smell them when they get out. My momma has given birth
                    twice. She had fourteen babies in two litters. Most were adopted out and five were eaten by the
                    mother! One of them fell off of the sundeck! I have two exercise balls with loose lids. This is the
                    main way that they escape! I love my hamsters! They make cool pets. Quiet and good natured! Time to
                    buy better exercise balls!</p>
